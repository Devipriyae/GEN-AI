#-GRAMMAR CORRECTION USING T5 TRANSFORMER
Project Overview:
  Grammar correction using the T5 transformer involves leveraging the power of a T5 model, a text-to-text transformer architecture. Import the necessary libraries and set up the HappyTextToText model with the 
T5 architecture and the "t5-base" checkpoint. Load the JFLEG dataset, split it into training and evaluation sets, and print some example cases from the dataset. Define a function to create CSV files for training 
and evaluation data, with the appropriate input and target format and generate the CSV files for training and evaluation data using this function. 
  Evaluate the model's performance on the evaluation dataset before fine-tuning and print the loss. Set training arguments, fine-tune the T5 model on the training dataset. After training, evaluate the model's 
performance on the evaluation dataset again and print the loss to see if fine-tuning improved the model's performance. You define two example sentences with grammar issues as input and use the fine-tuned model to 
generate corrected versions. 
  Overall, this code serves as a practical example of how to fine-tune and utilize a T5 model for grammar correction tasks using the HappyTextToText library and the JFLEG dataset. It demonstrates data preparation, 
model fine-tuning, and generating corrected text. This approach makes use of the T5 model's ability to convert text from one form to another, allowing it to excel at a wide range of natural language processing 
tasks, including grammar correction.
